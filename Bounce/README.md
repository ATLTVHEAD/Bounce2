Version
====================

1.6: Fixed for Arduino 1.0

1.5: Added risingEdge and fallingEdge

1.3: Fixed a bug that was confusing a local variable and an argument

1.2: Added a duration method

1.1: Removed a badly formated comment that would halt compiling

1.0: Initial Release

Description
====================

Bounce is a library for Arduino (arduino.cc). It debounces digital inputs and more (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debounce#Contact_bounce).

Download, install and import
====================

â€¢ Put the Bounce folder in your Arduino "libraries".  To identify this location open "menu -> File -> Preferences". 


In the Arduino IDE, select "menubar->Sketch->Import Library->Bounce"  to import the library to your sketch. An "#include Bounce.h" line will appear  at the top of your Sketch.

You can also find examples under "menubar->File->Sketchbook->libraries->Bounce"


Methods
====================

# Bounce(byte pin,unsigned long debounce_interval)

Instantiates a Debounce object for the specified pin with a debounce time.

Because Bounce does not use interrupts, you have to "update" the object before reading its value.

# int update()

Updates Bounce. Returns true if the pin state changed (HIGH to LOW or LOW to HIGH). False if not.

# void interval(unsigned long interval) 

Changes the debounce time in milliseconds.


# int read()
Reads the updated pin state.

# void write(int state)
Sets the stored pin state 

# void rebounce(unsigned long interval)
Forces the pin to signal a state change in X milliseconds even if the state does not actually change.
Example: A button that repeats every X milliseconds as long as it is held down

# unsigned long duration(void)
Returns the number of milliseconds the pin has been in the current state.

# bool risingEdge()
// The risingEdge method is true for one scan after the de-bounced input goes from off-to-on.

# bool fallingEdge();
The fallingEdge  method it true for one scan after the de-bounced input goes from on-to-off.
